\section{Introduction}

Retinomorphic event cameras are biologically inspired cameras that unlike traditional cameras do not capture entire intensity of the visual space at a given time. Instead, these sensors capture any change in intensity of pixels in the visual space (beyond a certain threshold) without being bounded by time \cite{boahen2005neuromorphic}. My lab rotation deals with implementing an image reconstruction algorithm and comparing it with a CNN algorithm ; further I intend to try a different dictionary learning algorithm to represent the events. The deliverable of the lab rotation is enumerated below :-

\begin{itemize}
  \item Study and implementation of Image Reconstruction by dictionary learning. \cite{barua2016direct}
  \item Study and analysis of FireNet.\cite{scheerlinck2020fast}
  \item Determine the metrics for comparison.
  \item Extend the algorithm by using a different dictionary learning methodology. \cite{fan2020robust}
\end{itemize}
